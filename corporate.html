          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The moms sometimes miss a support system, in any kind of way (friends)</li>
            <li>They do not like the current dating scene, as most of them are happily single (dating apps)</li>
            <li>Because of their dating past they do not feel the need to connect with other people on a dating level and are not willing to put in the effort of getting to know someone anymore (not solved since they are not dating.)</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Yoga classes desinged for middle-aged single owmen</li>
            <li>After the yoga classes, Femme-Unity offers a support group so the women can talk about their experiences, struggles, etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Working women</li>
            <li>Between 35-50 Years old</li>
            <li>Goals: focussing on personal well-being, and improving on work/life BredaUniversityofAppliedSciences</li>
            <li>Personality: kind, compassionate, empathetic. </li>
            <li>Values: community, connection, and personal growth</li>
            <li>They have a need that is not met and are therefore early adapters, since the women miss a support system and they are currently missing that. And there are no existing products or technologies that could help them to meet there need. </li>

          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Femme-unity offers yoga classes, and after the class it offers a support group, it provides middle aged single moms a break from their busy day-to-day life, and it gives them the opportunity to create a supporting network.  </li>
            
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Access to an expert: one of the teams’ family members has experience with teaching yoga and working with single moms experiencing problems in their day-to-day life. So, she can teach the yoga classes, and afterwards guide the support group. Next to this, she is also part of the target group as she is a single middle-aged mom. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Instagram was chosen as a main channel, because during our interviews we noticed that it was one of the most used platforms by the middle-aged single women. However, they did also mention Facebook, but we decided not to go for that platform since we wanted to put in all our efforts in one platform and would like to reach as many people as possible. We also know Instagram the best as a social media platform, and since it is so familiar, we thought we were more likely to have bigger results. We have all kinds of different posts: women who are enjoying yoga, women chatting after their yoga class, wellness tips, etc. We also use engaging captions to reach our target audience, as well as hashtags. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Instagram followers: 55</li>
            <li>Reached Accounts: 139</li>
            <li>Likes: 175</li>
            <li>Reactions: 53</li>

          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Single class fee: We charge a fee for each individual yoga class, and it is set at €12.50. This is a usage fee-based revenue model. 
              <li>Subscription: the business offers a discounted rate for those who purchase a package deal of classes in advance. For instance, 10 yoga classes are offered for €115, providing a discount compared to paying for each individual class. This is a subscription-based revenue model. </li>
            <li>Merchandise: ones the business is rising in popularity we could sell branded merchandise, such as yoga mats, tote bags or t-shirts to generate additional revenue. This is an asset-sale based subscription model since Femme-Unity would sell ownership to a physical product.  </li>
              <li> Renting out our space: with advertising we want to let people know that it is possible to rent our space for a couple of hours, so people could host their events here. This would be a renting-based revenue model, since we would temporarily grant someone the exclusive right to use our space. </li>
             	<li>Teacher training programs & workshop: we offer trainings and workshops to middle aged women who might be interested to become a yoga teacher. Since they must pay for the workshop and training this could be an additional revenue stream. This is a usage fee-based revenue model. </li>
              </li>
          </ul>

          <p> Overall, the revenue model for the business is based on providing yoga classes for middle-aged single moms in the Netherlands and charging fees for attending these classes. The business generates revenue from multiple streams such as single class fees, package deals, scholarship fees and merchandise.

            <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Justification</h4>
          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          
          <p>Assumption 1: By offering a combination of yoga classes and a supportive community environment, we will attract and retain a loyal customer base of middle-aged single moms living in the Netherlands During our problem interviews, we saw that most of them mist some kind of support, and we implemented this need with yoga classes and a support group. During our solution interviews, we provided them a prototype where they had yoga classes and support groups and they all found that this was a good solution to fulfill that need. 
          </p>
          <p>Link to the lean canvas: This assumption is related to the Customer Segments section of the Lean Canvas and the Value Proposition section. By identifying our target audience, and providing an unique value proposition of a supportive community combined with yoga classes, we believe that we can build and retain customers who are seeking for a sense of support and a place to work on their mental- and physical health. This assumption will help with our marketing and branding strategies so we are ensured that we will reach our target audience and communicating our value proposition.  </p>
          
          <p>Assumption 2: the set price of €12.50 per class is a good price, since most of them find it cheap or exactly the right price for a new yoga business. By offering package deals and subscriptions for yoga classes, there is a possibility to generate a significant portion of our revenue and increase our customer loyalty. </p>
          <p>Link to the lean canvas: This assumption is linked to the Revenue Streams and Cost structure sections of the Lean Canvas. By offering package deals and subscriptions we can increase the predictability of our revenue and it will help us optimize our cost structure by reducing the need for constant marketing and advertising efforts to attract new customers since we will hopefully create a loyal customer base. </p>
         
          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Conclusion of the interviews</h4>

          <p>Problem interviews</p>
          <p> After conducting interviews, it is clear that most women are perfectly happy being single and are not actively looking for a romantic partner. There are many different reasons for this, like changes in the dating world or personal experiences with relationships, and some women just do not feel like pursuing a relationship currently. However, it is clear from the interviews that all the women miss some kind of support system in any way. This could mean getting emotional support, or even professional support. They mentioned that being single is fulfilling to them, but they did express a desire for more community events or social activities geared towards middle aged single, which could provide an opportunity to meet like-minded individuals in a low-pressure setting. </p>
          
          <p> Conclusion Interviews</p>
          <p>After conducting the solution interviews, we discovered some valuable insights. The women who were interviewed, were excited about the prices and loved the idea of combining yoga classes with a support group. However, they did mention that it maybe should be another word instead of support group. They appreciated the affordability of the program, which could eventually in the future could be a little bit more expensive.  
            During the interviews, the women expressed interest in having the option to form groups with the same women each time they attended the support group. They believed that seeing familiar faces would build trust and allow them to form deeper connections with each other over time. Additionally, some women didn’t feel the need to have a support group, but still liked the idea of having yoga classes with the same age group. Because this way they are not confronted with younger people, who might be able to do more, and this would make them feel more confident and comfortable during the yoga classes. Therefore, in the future we will consider offering separate options for the support groups and yoga classes to accommodate different preferences. They also spoke about the possibility of having a place where there children be taken care of while they are having their yoga classes, because this way it makes it easier for them to attend the yoga classes.  
            Overall, the interviews showed that there is a demand for a women’s support group and yoga business, but it’s also important to consider the needs and preferences of the target audience to create a successful engaging program.  
            </p>
          
            <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Demo/ prototype</h4>
            <p>Femme-Unity offers yoga classes in the Netherlands, especially for middle-aged single moms. The classes are designed to provide moms with a much-needed break from their hectic schedules, and to offer them an opportunity to socialize, and creating a supporting network with like-minded women. Since most moms have a lot on their plate, we will offer flexible scheduling options. Moms can choose to attend individual classes for €20,- or purchase a package of 10 classes at discounted rate of €115. This way, they can fit it in their busy schedules how they like it without any stress our pressure. 
              Since the costs of the program may be a barrier for some, we made it as accessible as possible, hence why the low price per class. But we will also set aside a small percentage of the fees for scholarships for moms who may not be able to afford the costs of the program. This way, every mom has the opportunity to join Femme-Unity and take part in the program regardless of their financial situation. 
              Our classes are led by an experienced yoga instructress, who understands the needs of middle-aged single moms since the has experience with teaching yoga, coaching single women and is a part of the target group herself. Within the classes we focus on relaxation, mindfulness, and self-care to help the moms find a balance and clarity amidst the chaos of their life. 
              At Femme-Unity we are committed to create a supportive and inclusive community for singe middle aged moms. We believe that by coming together and taking care of ourselves, we can empower ourselves and one another to live happier and healthier lives.
